# cc-services

A collection of Clojure wrappers to Computational Creativity Web Services.

## Rationale

Understanding and parsing the XML/JSON transmitted by web services can be tiresome.
This library has been written to save me from doing this multiple times.

## Content

Currently provides access to the Creative Language System Group's Web Services created by Tony Veale.
For an overview of these systems see this [presentation](http://videolectures.net/ascc2013_veale_web/) or check this [paper](http://www-ipv4.cl.cam.ac.uk/~es407/papers/meta4NLP2014.pdf#page=62).

## Usage

Add `[org.clojars.triss/cc-services "0.1.1-SNAPSHOT"]` to your lein dependencies.
For now you should refer to the source for documentation.
